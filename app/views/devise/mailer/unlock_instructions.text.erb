<% title "Handlisted.in: unlock account" %>
<%= salutation %>

Someone is trying to log in to your account, but he had so many
unsuccessful attempts. We locked him out of our system, since that
looked suspicious. We are extremely sorry if that was you, but you need
to understand that we were trying to be safe rather than giving someone
access to your account.

You can unlock your account by opening the link below:

<%= unlock_url(@resource, unlock_token: @token) %>

Again, we are sorry that you had such trouble accessing your account,
but there are always things in life we don't enjoy doing.
What's important is that you can now login to your account easily.
Waiting for you.....
