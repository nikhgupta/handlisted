Someone has requested a link to change your password.
You can do by opening the link below:

<%= edit_password_url(@resource, reset_password_token: @token) %>

We are sorry that you had such trouble accessing your account, but there
are always things in life we don't enjoy doing. What's important is that
you can now login to your account easily. Waiting for you.....

<% footer do %>
If you didn't request this, please ignore this email.
Your password won't change until you access the above link.
<% end %>
