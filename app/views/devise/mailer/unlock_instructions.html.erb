<p>
  Someone is trying to log in to your account, but he had so many
  unsuccessful attempts. We locked him out of our system, since that
  looked suspicious. We are extremely sorry if that was you, but you need
  to understand that we were trying to be safe rather than giving someone
  access to your account.
</p>

<p>You can unlock your account by opening the link below:</p>

<p class='linked'>
  <%= link_to 'Unlock my account',
    unlock_url(@resource, unlock_token: @token),
    class: "warning" %>
</p>

<p>
  Again, we are sorry that you had such trouble accessing your account,
  but there are always things in life we don't enjoy doing.
  What's important is that you can now login to your account easily.
  Waiting for you.....
</p>
