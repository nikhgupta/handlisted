# Feature: Add Product from Search bar
#   In order to add a new product to CuratedShop
#   As a User
#   I want to be able to add products by pasting URL in site-wise Search bar

#   @focus @javascript
#   Scenario: Amazon Product
#     Given I am logged in as user with email: "user@example.com"
#      When I go to the home page
#       And I enter the source url of product: "amazon echo" in sitewide search
#      # Then I should stay on the home page
#      Then I should see "Found that!"
#       And product: "echo" should exist with name: "Amazon Echo"
#       And the product's price should be "$179.99"
